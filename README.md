# Project Information

In this personal project, I created an Employee Management system that allows for an Administrator and an Employee to access a database. Adminstrators will be able to login and have access to Employee information, which includes viewing and updating Employee details. Employees will be able to login to view their personal details, clock in/out, and logout.

Clock in Clock out button (Time clocked in, Clocked out etc.)
Important message *can not clock  out intill your atleast 10 minutes into your shift
timesheet card of all clocked in clocked outs through the week, month year. 
vacation hours, sick hours

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I login as an Administrator
THEN I am presented with the ability to create employees and view all employees and update employee information.
