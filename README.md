# Project Information

In this personal project, I created an Employee Management system that allows for an Administrator and an Employee to access a database. Adminstrators will be able to login and have access to Employee information, which includes viewing and updating Employee details. Employees will be able to login to view their personal details, clock in/out, and logout.
